Completed 8/28/18

The GitHub tutorial taught me about the following commands that GitHub uses: git: prefix to any of the following commands commit: saves changes to the repository checkout: selects which change in the repository will be the head of the repository branch: used to manage branches (move changes, add new branches for testing new features, etc.) merge: merges two branches into a single branch (as to combine changes) cherry-pick: used to pick specific changes out of a branch and clone them to another branch rebase: similar to cherry-pick, clones changes (after a base) to another base reset: reverses changes (without showing the changes reversed) revert: reverses changes (while making a copy of the changes reversed) I look forward to using GitHub functionality in the future.
